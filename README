What is this?
=============

This repository contains the main web site dedicated to mod-xslt,
a module to perform on the flight transformation of xml to html
(or other formats) using xsl stylesheets.

If you look at the directories in this repository...

... http/ contains the whole site. It is mostly written in .xml,
using a simplified docbook syntax, named "sdope". You can also
see the structure of a FAQ, a software archive, and of course
the menus and the skeleton of the web site is described in xml.

... lib/ contains the stylesheets used to turn all of the above
documents into html. Each set of stylesheets is mostly self contained
and has been used on a number of different sites.

  Feel free to use the code of this web site or its content
as indicated by the original http/main/legals.xml file.
